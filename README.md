In this project, 4 peers and I attempted to test the viability of Neural Network Image processing in medical fields. In this project, we attempted to construct a convolutional network that could detect chest catheters in X-rays and determine whether they had been placed correctly or where going to cause harm to patients in the long term.

Grade Earned: High Distinction

Throughout the first two years of a Bachelor of Data Science (Advanced) at Monash students complete 4 data-driven group projects on their choice of provided topics. This was my fourth of these 4 projects and was completed in Year 2 Semester 2 of my degree.

The main skill of this process was creative model design and model fitting. The task of identifying a catheter's placement becomes far more difficult when there are sometimes many different types of catheters in the same x-ray, all of which need to be assessed. This is where we had to get creative with model design and how we would use our knowledge of algorithmic thinking to break a large problem into several interlinked binary problems. Once we had made this decomposition a large variety of image processing techniques and a deep knowledge of neural network image processing was required to train each of these binary models. 

A comprehensive report our results and process is included as part of this repository.
